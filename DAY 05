Cybersecurity Notes â€“ Day 05
1. Ports & Port Numbers
Imagine ports as doors into your computer â€” each service/application uses a specific one.

Port Number = unique ID for each door.

Range: 0 â€“ 65535

0â€“1023 â†’ Well-Known Ports (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH)

1024â€“49151 â†’ Registered Ports (specific applications)

49152â€“65535 â†’ Dynamic/Ephemeral Ports (temporary connections)

2. Common Service Ports
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Port 21 â†’ Control channel

Purpose: Transfer files between client â†” server

Not secure (plain text)

Alternative: SFTP â†’ Port 22 (SSH-based, encrypted)

Other Important Ports:

HTTP â†’ Port 80

HTTPS â†’ Port 443

SSH â†’ Port 22

3. Linux User Types
Root User â†’ The super-admin ðŸ«¡ (full control)

Regular User â†’ Standard daily account

Service Accounts â†’ For apps/services, not humans

4. Privilege Escalation in Linux
Definition: Gaining more permissions than assigned.

Types:

Vertical â†’ From normal user â†’ root

Horizontal â†’ Access another userâ€™s data without extra privileges

Common Methods:

Misconfigured sudo settings

Weak file/directory permissions

Kernel exploits

5. Linux Command Spotlight: watch
Purpose: Runs a command repeatedly, updating the display.

Syntax:

bash
Copy
Edit
watch [options] command
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
watch -n 5 date
(Displays current date/time every 5 seconds.)

6. Security Operations Center (SOC)
The command center for cybersecurity defense.

Functions: Monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real time.

Roles:

Tier 1 Analyst â†’ First-line alert handling

Tier 2 Analyst â†’ Detailed investigation

Incident Responder â†’ Containment & recovery

7. Cybersecurity Learning Platforms
Example: TryHackMe â€” interactive labs, guided challenges, and hands-on hacking tasks.

Skills you can practice: Reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, etc.

Alternatives: HackTheBox, OverTheWire
